Description: In the world of bioinformatics, there are many different possible pipelines
             and protocols that one can employ. Unfortunately, rapidly switching between
			 different approaches is generally not easy and often requires a lot of manual
			 work. The aim of RNAseqsuite is to provide a convienent cli wrapper over 
			 popular RNAseq software and algorithms to simplify the process for performing
			 RNAseq and different analyses on the fly.
