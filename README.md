##RNASeqSuite

**Note**: This is a WIP and is only here for convenience. Don't expect anything to work properly at this stage.

RNASeqSuite is intended to be a handy cli wrapper in R around common RNASeq processing libraries to ease the workflow, simplify user input, and allow for quick, on-the-fly switching of algorithms and statistical tests.
